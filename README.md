## Fun Fact
he first computer "bug" was an actual bug! In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University, discovered a moth stuck in the machine's components. This was causing an error, and upon its discovery, she remarked they were "debugging" the system. This is where the term "debugging" comes from in computer programming
